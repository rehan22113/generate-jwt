# JWT Authentication and Authorization System

This project implements a JWT-based authentication and authorization system using Node.js and the `jsonwebtoken` library. The system aims to enhance the security of user authentication and protect against common security vulnerabilities.

## Features

- Generation of JWT tokens with digital signatures
- Verification and decoding of JWT tokens
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Protection of routes using JWT authentication

## Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

1. Start the server: `node server.js`
2. Generate a JWT token: `GET /generate-token`
3. Verify and decode the JWT token: `GET /verify-token`
4. Generate a token with expiration: `GET /generate-expiring-token`
5. Access protected routes: `GET /protected-route`

## Configuration

- Set your own secret key for signing and verifying tokens in the `server.js` file: `const secretKey = 'your-secret-key'`

## Dependencies

- `jsonwebtoken`: For JWT token generation, verification, and cryptographic operations
- `express`: For setting up the server and handling routes
